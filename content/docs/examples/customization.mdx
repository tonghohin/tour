You can customize the appearance of each tour step using various properties like `side`, `align`, `className`, and more.

If you want to change the style for all steps at once, you can do it directly in your `tour.tsx`.

## Example

```tsx showLineNumbers title="lib/steps.tsx"
import { type Step } from "@/components/ui/tour"
import { ArrowRightIcon, CheckIcon } from "lucide-react"

export const steps = [
    {
        id: "positioning",
        title: "Positioning",
        content:
            "Each tour step uses the Popover component, so you can pass any props supported by Popover Content.",
        side: "bottom",
        sideOffset: 10,
        align: "start",
        alignOffset: 10,
    },
    {
        id: "styling",
        title: "Custom Styling",
        content: "Apply your own styles to the tour step using className.",
        className: "w-96 bg-destructive",
    },
    {
        id: "buttonLabels",
        title: "Custom Button Labels",
        content:
            "Customize the labels of the next and previous buttons on each step.",
        previousLabel: <>← Previous Step</>,
        nextLabel: (
            <>
                Complete Tour <CheckIcon />
            </>
        ),
    },
] satisfies Step[]
```
