title: Multiple Tours
description: Define and manage multiple independent tours in your application.
component: true
---

You can define multiple independent tours for different features or workflows in your application. Each tour is identified by a unique `id` and can be started separately.

## Setup

Define multiple tours in your `TourProvider`:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="lib/tours.ts"
import { type Tour } from "@/components/ui/tour"

export const tours = [
    {
        id: "onboarding",
        steps: [
            {
                id: "welcome",
                title: "Welcome!",
                content: "Welcome to our app. Let's get you started.",
            },
            {
                id: "dashboard",
                title: "Your Dashboard",
                content: "This is your main dashboard.",
            },
        ],
    },
    {
        id: "settings-guide",
        steps: [
            {
                id: "profile",
                title: "Profile Settings",
                content: "Customize your profile here.",
            },
            {
                id: "preferences",
                title: "Preferences",
                content: "Set your app preferences.",
            },
        ],
    },
] satisfies Tour[]
```

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/layout.tsx"
import { TourProvider } from "@/components/ui/tour"
import { tours } from "@/lib/tours"

export default function RootLayout() {
    return <TourProvider tours={tours}>{/* Your app content */}</TourProvider>
}
```

## Starting Different Tours

Use the `useTour` hook to start specific tours by their ID:

```tsx showLineNumbers
"use client"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { useTour } from "@/components/ui/tour"

export function TourButtons() {
    const tour = useTour()

    return (
        <div>
            <Button onClick={() => tour.start("onboarding")}>
                Start Onboarding
            </Button>
            <Button onClick={() => tour.start("settings-guide")}>
                Settings Guide
            </Button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Use Cases

Multiple tours are useful for:

- **Onboarding vs. Feature Tours**: Separate initial user onboarding from specific feature walkthroughs
- **Role-Based Tours**: Different tours for different user roles (admin, editor, viewer)
- **Context-Specific Guides**: Show different tours based on the current page or user action
