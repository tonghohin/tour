Create tours that navigate across multiple pages by using the `nextRoute` and `previousRoute` properties.

## Example

```tsx showLineNumbers title="lib/steps.ts"
import { type Step } from "@/components/ui/tour"

export const steps = [
    {
        id: "home-hero",
        title: "Welcome",
        content: "Welcome to our application! Let's start the tour.",
        nextRoute: "/dashboard", // Navigate to dashboard on next
    },
    {
        id: "dashboard-stats",
        title: "Dashboard",
        content: "Here you can see your key metrics and statistics.",
        previousRoute: "/", // Navigate back to home on previous
        nextRoute: "/settings", // Navigate to settings on next
    },
    {
        id: "settings-profile",
        title: "Settings",
        content: "Customize your profile and preferences here.",
        previousRoute: "/dashboard", // Navigate back to dashboard
    },
] satisfies Step[]
```
