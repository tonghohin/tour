---

## Prerequisite

Before installing, make sure you already have **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)** set up in your project.

## Installation

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://onboarding-tour.vercel.app/r/tour.json
```

## Concepts

### Tour

A **Tour** represents a complete onboarding flow or a guide for a specific feature. It is identified by a unique `id` and contains a sequence of steps. You can define multiple tours in your application (e.g., "onboarding", "new-feature-x", "settings-guide") and start them independently.

### Step

A **Step** is a single card in the tour sequence. Each step targets a specific element on the page using the `data-tour-step-id` attribute. Steps can be customized with a title, content, navigation labels, and positioning preferences.

## Usage

### Setup

First, wrap your application with the `TourProvider` component. This provides the tour context to your entire app:

```tsx showLineNumbers title="app/layout.tsx"
import { type Tour, TourProvider } from "@/components/ui/tour"

const tours = [
    {
        id: "main",
        steps: [
            {
                id: "welcome",
                title: "Welcome",
                content: "Let's take a quick tour of the main features.",
            },
            {
                id: "feature-1",
                title: "Feature One",
                content: "This is an important feature.",
            },
        ],
    },
] satisfies Tour[]

export default function RootLayout() {
    return <TourProvider tours={tours}>{/* Your app content */}</TourProvider>
}
```

### Starting the Tour

Use the `useTour` hook to control the tour from anywhere in your app:

```tsx showLineNumbers
"use client"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { useTour } from "@/components/ui/tour"

export function StartTourButton() {
    const tour = useTour()

    return <Button onClick={() => tour.start("main")}>Start Tour</Button>
}
```

### Targeting Elements

Add `data-tour-step-id` attributes to elements you want to highlight in the tour. The tour will automatically find and highlight elements matching the step's `id`:

```tsx showLineNumbers
<div data-tour-step-id="welcome">
    <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
</div>

<div data-tour-step-id="feature-1">
    <p>This is a feature</p>
</div>

<div data-tour-step-id={["welcome", "feature-1"]}>
    <p>This element appears in both steps</p>
</div>
```
